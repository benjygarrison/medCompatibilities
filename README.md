This is a JavaFX/SQL project.

It was a school project. It’s a basic program that allows users to search, add, delete, and edit medications and the solutions with which they’re compatible.

It originally pulled from a single-table database that was created in MySQL and stored on AWS. The database is now disabled. I’ve included the DB schema for reference.

Thanks for checking out my code!
